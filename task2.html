	    <h1 align="center"><u>About website</u></h1>
	    <p id="detail_one">
		<u><b>Facebook</b></u>, Inc. is an American online social media and social networking service company based in Menlo Park, California. Its 
		website was launched  February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates 
		Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. It is considered one of the Big Four technology 
		companies along with Amazon, Apple, and Google.
		<br>
		<label style="margin-left:50px;"></label>
	     The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students and subsequently Columbia, Stanford, and Yale
		 students. Membership was eventually expanded to the remaining Ivy League schools, MIT, and higher education institutions in 
		 the Boston area. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school 
		 students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, 
		 though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given 
		 to American university students. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 
		 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. It began selling stock to the public three months later. 
		 Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements that appear onscreen.

		 <u><b>Google</b></u> LLC[5] is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which 
		 include online advertising technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.
         <br>
		 <label style="margin-left:50px;"></label>
         Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. 
		 Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. 
		 They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 
		 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google 
		 announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and 
		 will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry 
		 Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.
		 <br>
		 <label style="margin-left:50px;"></label>
		 The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core 
		 search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google 
		 Slides), email (Gmail/Inbox), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking 
		 (Google+),

		 <b><u>Microsoft Corporation (MS)</u></b> is an American multinational technology company with headquarters in Redmond, Washington. It 
		 develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related 
		 services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the 
		 Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface 
		 lineup of touchscreen personal computers. As of 2016, it is the world's largest software maker by revenue,[3] and one of the world's 
		 most valuable companies. The word "Microsoft" is a portmanteau of "microcomputer" and "software".[5] Microsoft is ranked No. 30 in
         the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.
        <br>

         Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to 
         dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The 
         company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 
         millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has 
         made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed
         by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.
